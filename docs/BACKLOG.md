# BoTCoin – Feature Backlog

The working backlog of features for BoTCoin. Each entry is independent and
self-contained — there is no fixed delivery order. Cards are grouped by status
and kept brief: the full design and implementation steps live in the linked spec
and plan.

**Status legend:** ✅ Shipped · 📋 Planned · 💤 Deferred

## ✅ Shipped

### Dynamic Pair Configuration

Per-pair trading parameters (`target_pct`, `hodl_pct`, `k_act`, `min_margin`,
`stop_pct_<level>`) editable at runtime via the HTTP API and Telegram, persisted
in PostgreSQL (DB-authoritative, seeded once from `.env`), with changes taking
effect on the next session without a restart. Shipped with a cleanup collapsing
`k_act`/`min_margin` from per-side to a single value per pair.

## 📋 Planned

### Trend/Chop Regime Filter

A Choppiness Index–based regime classifier (`TREND`/`MIXED`/`CHOP`) that gates
new position entries during sideways markets while leaving the trailing-stop
exit logic untouched. Reuses the existing OHLC + ATR pipeline, no new external
dependencies. Ships in two stages — observation first (publish the regime via
API/Telegram), enforcement second (gate entries on `regime != CHOP`).

- Spec: _to be written_

### Auto-Lookback Window for K_STOP Calibration

Replace full-history K_STOP calibration with a data-driven lookback window
selected per pair via a stability sweep, so stop sizing reflects the current
volatility regime rather than the entire price history.

**Note:** the plateau heuristic needs a meaningful history range to produce a
stable signal — more than 60 days of OHLC data are required.
